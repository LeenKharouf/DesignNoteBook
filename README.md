# Leen's Design Notebook

## Week of Feb 4 2024

- Created a Notebook
- Learned github from Rishyak

## Week of February 25 2024
- [Lab1 completed](https://github.com/LeenKharouf/lab1)
- Understanding how it all works 
- I'm very behind on starting labs so I have a lot of catching up to do
- I've had issues with cmake and homebrew - I installed and reinstalled multiple times because they keep saying "command not found", but I realised at the end that you have to install it in the parent repository so that they work in all child repositories.

## Week of March 5 2024
- [Lab2 completed](https://github.com/LeenKharouf/onboarding-lab-2)
- Learned about bit concatenation
- Nice refresher for Verilog and I realised I forgot a few stuff.

## Week of March 26  2024
- [started lab3](https://github.com/LeenKharouf/onboarding-lab-3)
- I started working on this lab and it introduced me to new complexities in digital circuit simulation. Unlike previous labs where test verifications were pre-written, I had to write my own this time.

## Week of April 4 2024
- [finished lab3](https://github.com/LeenKharouf/onboarding-lab-3)
- I learned to handle the simulation of negative edge clock triggers effectively by alternating the clock's state between high and low for each evaluation cycle. This approach was crucial for accurately simulating the behavior of digital circuits under test conditions.


## Week of April 16 2024
- [completed lab4](https://github.com/LeenKharouf/onboarding-lab-4)
- LFSR Functionality Test:
- Understanding LFSR Mechanics: This code taught me a practical understanding of Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR), which are used for generating pseudo-random sequences. The feedback mechanisms produce a sequence that appears random but is, in fact, deterministic and repeatable, making them useful in simulations, cryptography, and digital data transmission. This was cool and i later decided to make my final presentation on how this is implemented to generate minecraft terrains.

- Custom Logic Unit Test:
- This taught me how to apply logical operations like AND, OR, XOR, and more complex combinations in a controlled test environment.


## Week of April 20 2024
- Worked on my final presentation
- researching Minecraft and LFSR (as mentioned in week of april 16)


## Week of May 2 2024
- [Some notes I made throughout the semester](https://carnation-eyeliner-5f1.notion.site/VIP-Processor-Chip-Design-3dee550913b544aa9b733f985dba2f55)
